This section and in fact this entire application is undergoing a complete overhaul. Presently uploaded in its current form to prove a basic fundamental understanding of API calls 
during a hopefully blissfully short interim, though how they are being rendered to the client defeats the purpose of using a loader in the first place-
not to mention BrowserRouter with explicitly defined components in a Remix file-based routing system.
The pending version will instead have proper file-based routing and will not erroneously be attempting to export loaders, instead calling them at the top of the page and utilizing useLoaderData.
