This section and in fact this entire application is undergoing a complete overhaul. Presently uploaded in its current form to prove a basic fundamental understanding of API calls 
during a hopefully blissfully short interim, though how they are being rendered to the client defeats the purpose of using a loader in the first place-
not to mention BrowserRouter with explicitly defined components in a Remix file-based routing system.
The pending version will have a useEffect inside of the async function and map multiple 
values that way instead of using getElementById and .then extensions as a bandaid. UI will be built accordingly afterwards, but the foundation of the app needs to be fixed first.
